## <a name="issue"></a> Problems?

If you've found a bug in the source or mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TumblThreeApp/TumblThree/issues), and even a pull request addressing the issue. Please ensure an issue is created prior to creating a pull request, and reference the issue number from the PR.

## <a name="feature"></a> Something Missing?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TumblThreeApp/TumblThree/issues). 

If you would like to implement a new feature yourself then first consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** - A new feature that is beyond an engineered extensibility point or otherwise of a non-trivial nature... Ensure an issue is open first You may also wish to raise the matter in the [Gitter TumblThree Development](https://gitter.im/TumblThree/Development) channel. Failing to do so may result in your PR being rejected.
* **Small Changes** - A simple change, bugfix, or feature leveraging a planned extsion point... You may create an issue of one doesn't already exist and a PR with no further consultation. Your PR has a higher probability of being accepted, but if no discussion has taken place prior to submission, prefix your PR with [WIP] to signify that your work is in progress, and discussion should take place within the pull request.
